This project is a project to be submitted for the 2024 HooHacks hackathon, hosted by UVA. 

## What is it?

HooStocks is a stock-analyzing application, being able to analyze stocks in real-time while having unlimited API calling and no rate-limiting.

It uses a LLM in order to provide a score for a user-inputted stock based on stock history, current price, P/E ratio, all-time highs and lows, and the stock company's value as a company amongst several other factors. 

## Team Members
- Yatin Jason Manuel
- Dang Le
- Jasmeet Bhamra
- Harry On


## Why this?

We chose to do this as we wanted to develop an application that would be able to provide users with a deep analysis of any inputted stock while incorporating a LLM into the project.


# Plans

#### What can we work on from here on out?
- Fixing the authentication system
- Adding more factors and considerations into the analysis process
- Taking advantage of more resources such as Intel Developer Cloud

## What have we learned from this experience?
- Plan earlier than the competition starting date next time
- Know / assign all team members' roles prior to arriving
- Manage our time better in order to visit more workshops
